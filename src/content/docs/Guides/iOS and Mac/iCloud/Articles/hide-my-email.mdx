Apple has a feature called [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102548) that creates a unique, random email address which forwards to your iCloud email address. This is used to hide your real email address from websites and services that you sign up for. This is a great way to keep your email address private and reduce the amount of spam you receive.

## How to create a Hide My Email address

There are two basic ways to create a Hide My Email address.

1. You can [create one when you sign up for a new service](#creating-a-hide-my-email-address-when-signing-up-for-a-new-service), or,
2. You can [create one in the iCloud settings](#creating-a-hide-my-email-address-in-icloud-settings) on your device.

### Creating a Hide My Email address when signing up for a new service

When signing up for a new service on the web, you can create a Hide My Email address right from the sign-up form.

<Steps>
  1. Click in the email address field on the sign-up form. [![Click in the email

  2. Click the "Hide My Email" option that appears in the dropdown list. You may
  have to scroll down in the dropdown list to see it. **NOTE: If you don't see
  the dropdown list appear, click outside of the email text box and then back
  inside the email textbox.** [![Click the "Hide My Email"
  option](/images/ProcedureImages/Signup2-701874BA-EC0C-4D10-8D05-3A164FB27AFE.webp)](/images/ProcedureImages/Signup2-701874BA-EC0C-4D10-8D05-3A164FB27AFE.jpg)
</Steps>

This will create an email address for you that forwards to your iCloud email address and save it in your iCloud settings automatically.

### Creating a Hide My Email address in iCloud settings

You can also create a Hide My Email address directly in the iCloud settings on your device. You will have to then copy and paste the Hide My Email address into the sign-up form.
